# Project-3_Matt-Augustyn
Real estate is a notoriously cyclical industry. The most recent major real estate recession occurred in 2007/2008 in relation to the housing crisis that originated  in the United States and rippled across the rest of the globe. Property markets across diverse geographies from Brazil to China to Portugal felt the impact of contracting capital markets and to varying degrees experienced follow on downturns. While many of these localized negative market epochs have been studied at length, there is more limited discussion and understanding surrounding the nature of global real estate cycles and their characteristics. This project seeks to move beyond the traditional  binary paradigm of “recession” vs  “growth”  periods, and develop a more nuanced approach for discussing :
1. How the global real estate market has performed over the past 5 years;
2. Whether market periods might be grouped in a meaningful way; and
3. Opportunities for future analysis. 

The project resulted in the successful development of 3 distincy periodic clustes based on quarterly data from the past 5 years.

Future work to build upon this initial assesment may include:

1. Use the classes to develop predictive classification models for real estate investment; 
2. Use natural language processing to develop more robust qualitative analysis within the classes identified by k-clustering process;    
3. Add additional countries to form a more complete composite (subject to data availability);
4. Adjust the data for inflation so that analysis is on a real returns basis; and 
5. Weight the various markets based on size, instead of purely on price change.

Please see attached the full presentation for a detailed overview of the project.
